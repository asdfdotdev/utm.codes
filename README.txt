= Development Resources =

utm.codes is built using development code not included in the WordPress.org download because it isn't required for use. This code includes the webpack build used to create our minified CSS and JavaScript as well as PHPUnit tests to ensure support of new WordPress releases.

All source code associated with utm.codes is open source, free to use for any purpose, and released under the GPL v2.0 license. Development code, including instructions for running both the build and tests, is available at the [utm.codes GitHub repository](https://github.com/asdfdotdev/utm.codes).

You can also [browse our build history at GitHub](https://github.com/asdfdotdev/utm.codes/actions).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the shorten link checkbox missing when I create a link? =

Shortening links requires a shortener be configured. Configure shortening under Settings > utm.codes.

= Why is the create social links checkbox missing when I create a link?  =

Batch social link creation requires selection of social networks. Select networks under Settings > utm.codes to create links for your preferred networks when batch creating social links.

= What if I need custom parameters in my links? =

Simply add the parameter to your Link URL (e.g. https://example.com/?param=value) and utm.codes will append the generated utm code values to the end of the url when you save the link.

= What if I need custom parameter formats? =

Adding your own custom formatting is easy with an API filter. Visit our GitHub wiki for examples and more details.

= What if I want to share links on a social network your settings don't support? =

Adding your own custom social network options is easy with an API filter. Visit our GitHub wiki for examples and more details.

= What if I want to shorten my links using a service other than Bitly or Rebrandly? =
